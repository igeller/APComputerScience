package ch05;import java.util.Scanner;/*	FileName:  TestScores.javaThis program utilizes a while-true loop to process the test score ofa student so that the associated letter grade is printed.  It will usea while (true) loop that will ask first for a student's test score.Valid scores are floating-point values between 0 and 100 inclusive.The loop code will also ask for the student's name.  Care needs to betaken 	to consume the hanging new line character from the score inputbefore asking for the name of the person.The while(true) loop should continue to run until the sentinel value-999 is entered.  The prompt and reading of the score value should beTHE VERY FIRST THING IN THE LOOP AND IT SHOULD BE IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWEDBY AN IF STATEMENT THAT CONTAINS A BREAK SO THAT THE LOOP WILL ENDIMMEDIATELY WHEN -999 IS ENTERED WITHOUT ALLOWING FOR THE REQUEST FORTHE NAME.When a valid score has been entered and the student's name, then anextended-if statement with COMPOUND BOOLEAN EXPRESSIONS for theconditions will be used to detect and print the correct letter grade.The extended if should NOT end with an else branchso it will have the form:if ()		else if ()		else if()	....else if ()Again:  Each condition of the extended if is a COMPOUND BOOLEAN EXPRESSION!The program should give appropriate output for every grade of this grading scale:97 - 100 = A+93 - 96  = A90 - 92  = A-87 - 89  = B+83 - 86  = B80 - 82  = B-77 - 79  = C+73 - 76  = C70 - 72  = C-67 - 69  = D+63 - 66  = D60 - 62  = D- 0 - 59  = FHowever, since the scores are floating-point values in this program,the compound boolean expressions in the extended-if statement must accountfor rounding.  So the actual grading scale (inclusive) is:	96.5 - 100.0 			= A+	92.5 - 96.499999999 	= A	89.5 - 92.499999999	= A-   	and so on ....	A not possible score is one below 0 or greater than 100.			Here is the output for a run of the program.  Note that grade averages for allranges haven't been entered!	Enter a score between 0 and 100, inclusive, or -999 to Quit:  101Enter your name:  BillBill, your score is not possible.Enter a score between 0 and 100, inclusive, or -999 to Quit:  96.7Enter your name:  MaryMary, your grade is an A+.Enter a score between 0 and 100, inclusive, or -999 to Quit:  96.4Enter your name:  SteveSteve, your grade is an A.Enter a score between 0 and 100, inclusive, or -999 to Quit:  92.4Enter your name:  CarolCarol, your grade is an A-.Enter a score between 0 and 100, inclusive, or -999 to Quit:  89.5Enter your name:  TedTed, your grade is an A-.Enter a score between 0 and 100, inclusive, or -999 to Quit:  -99.5Enter your name:  PhilPhil, your score is not possible.Enter a score between 0 and 100, inclusive, or -999 to Quit:  -999Program Terminated.Run the program and enter appropriate test values from the keyboard which willattempt to provide complete code testing of your source code.*/public class TestScores{	public static void main (String[] args)	{		Scanner reader = new Scanner(System.in);		while (true)		{			System.out.print("Enter a score between 0.0 and 100.0 or -999 to Quit:  ");																				} // end while		System.out.println ("Program Terminated.");	} // end main} // end TestScores
