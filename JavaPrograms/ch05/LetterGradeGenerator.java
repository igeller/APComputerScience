package ch05;import java.util.Scanner;/*	FileName:  LetterGradeGenerator.javaThis program utilizes a while-true loop to process the grade average ofa student so that the associated letter grade is printed.  It will usea while (true) loop that will ask first for a student's grade average.Valid averages are floating-point values between 0 and 100 inclusive.The loop code will also ask for the student's name.  Care needs to betaken to consume the hanging new line character from the average inputbefore asking for the name of the person.The while(true) loop should continue to run until the sentinel value-999 is entered.  The prompt and reading of the average value should beTHE VERY FIRST THING IN THE LOOP AND IT SHOULD BE IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWEDBY AN IF STATEMENT THAT CONTAINS A BREAK SO THAT THE LOOP WILL ENDIMMEDIATELY WHEN -999 IS ENTERED WITHOUT ALLOWING FOR THE REQUEST FORTHE NAME.When a valid average has been entered and the student's name, then anextended-if statement with COMPOUND BOOLEAN EXPRESSIONS for theconditions will be used to detect and print the correct letter grade.The extended if should NOT end with an else branchso it will have the form:if ()		else if ()		else if()	....else if ()Again:  Each condition of the extended if is a COMPOUND BOOLEAN EXPRESSION!The program should give appropriate output for every average of this grading scale:97 - 100 = A+93 - 96  = A90 - 92  = A-87 - 89  = B+83 - 86  = B80 - 82  = B-77 - 79  = C+73 - 76  = C70 - 72  = C-67 - 69  = D+63 - 66  = D60 - 62  = D- 0 - 59  = FHowever, since the averages are floating-point values in this program,the compound boolean expressions in the extended-if statement must accountfor rounding.  So the actual grading scale (inclusive) is:	96.5 - 100.0 			= A+	92.5 - 96.499999999 	= A	89.5 - 92.499999999	= A-   	and so on ....	A not possible average is one below 0 or greater than 100.		Here is the output for a run of the program.
