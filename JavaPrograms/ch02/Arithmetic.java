/* Arithmetic.java Driver Program	The Arithmetic class is a driver program because it contains a main method.		We can write code in a driver program's main method and then run the program	and see the results in the console window.		In this program you will learn how to use the mathematical operators and how	to use concatenation to efficiently output data to the screen.*/// The next line declares the package (folder) where this file is stored in your JavaPrograms // project folder.package ch02;// import the Scanner classimport java.util.Scanner;// The following is the class definition line.
